# motion-planning-roadmap
Roadmap of areas of study in motion planning

### Notes
* Admissibility of a Heuristic : Guaranteed to not overestimate to cost of least cost path from any state to the goal
* Backward search : is more benefitial if you know that the goal is stationary but robot is moving so costs can be reused for replanning if needed
* Free space assumption : Whatever you dont know assume it as free space to ensure completeness
